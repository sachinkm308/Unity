# Unity

DemoScript.cs is the file where the logic is written to display 10 random green cubes and spheres and 1 red cube. Currently there is a bit 
overlapping of the objects at the moment.

Time on Screen is displayed when a click of the mouse or any button is pressed. The program exits after that.
